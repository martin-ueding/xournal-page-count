Xournal page count
##################

I use Xournal_ for all of my hand written notes for a while now and I was
wondering how much paper I actually saved.

Call it onto your ``.xoj`` files, it will count the number of pages that are
contained in them::

    xournal-page-count **/*.xoj

It will then output a summary::

    Total:
        397 pages.
        0.0397 meters in height.
        1.985 kilograms
        3.16806 â‚¬.
